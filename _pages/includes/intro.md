# About Me

I now research at [HKU IoT Lab](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~iotlab/) advised by [Dr. Edith Ngai](https://www.eee.hku.hk/people/echngai/). I am particularly interested in solving the issues in machine learning brought by heterogeneous data distributions, e.g., heterogeneity in the spacial domain (federated learning) and the temporal domain (lifelong learning).

Life is about adventuring. When I first came to Hong Kong for a Bachelor's degree in economics and finance in 2018, I wouldn't have imagined my transfer to statistics one year later. The journey has been fun, I met wonderful people, and I was fortunate enough to have [Prof. Stephen Lee](https://www.scifac.hku.hk/people/lee-stephen-man-sing) supervising my capstone on statistical inference. This also marked the turning point of my life. I realized how important a role computer simulations play even in some theoretical aspects of statistics, which drove me to think outside the box -- What about trying something more engineering? So here I am.
