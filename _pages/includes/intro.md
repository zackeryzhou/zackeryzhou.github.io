# About Me
Life is about adventuring. When I first came to Hong Kong for a Bachelor's degree in economics and finance in 2018, I wouldn't have imagined that I transfered to study statistics one year later. The journey has been fun, I met wonderful people, and I was fortunate enough to have [Prof. Stephen Lee](https://www.scifac.hku.hk/people/lee-stephen-man-sing) as my supervisor for my capstone on post-model-selection inference. This also marked the turning point of my life. I realized how important a role computer simulations play even in some theoretical aspects of statistics, which drove me to think outside the box -- What about trying something more engineering? So here I am. 

I now research under [Dr. Edith Ngai](https://www.eee.hku.hk/people/echngai/)'s supervision at [HKU IoT Lab](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~iotlab/). I am particularly interested in solving the issues in machine learning brought by heterogeneous data distributions, e.g., heterogeneity in the spacial domain (federated learning) and in the temporal domain (lifelong learning).
