``Jan 2024`` [Lemosho Traverse](https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/trail/tanzania/kilimanjaro/mount-kilimanjaro-lemosho-traverse?p=-1&sh=qlmoma), Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania
- At the start of 2024, I accomplished the Lemosho Traverse at Mt. Kilimanjaro — a memorable 7-day, 6-night expedition. The journey took me through diverse landscapes, from moorland and alpine desert to the snow-capped peak, culminating with tropical rainforests on the final day.
- On the night of Jan 5, we embarked on our summit ascent, marched towards Stella point (5,756 m), and eventually at around 7am reached Uhuru peak, Africa's highest point, standing at 5,895 meters.
- "Hakuna matata," as the local guide assured us, means "There are no troubles".

``Oct 2023`` [MacLehose Trail: Section 2「麥理浩徑第二段」](https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/trail/hong-kong/sai-kung/maclehose-trail-section-2?sh=qlmoma), Sai Kung, Hong Kong
- Section 2 is known as the essence of the famous trail. Throughout the 13.5 km hike, we were constantly surrounded by some of Hong Kong's most unspoiled beaches. We hadn't had time to visit Sharp Peak 「蚺蛇尖」 nearby all together, renowned as the sharpest peak in HK -- You can tell that from the photo! We will have the chance someday.

- Setting foot on a real-life "[tombolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombolo)" was an incredible experience that instantly brought back memories of playing [Don't Starve: Shipwrecked](https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked), where I struggled to navigate between islands.

``Jul 2022`` [Kwo Chau Islands「果洲群島」](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninepin_Group), Sai Kung, Hong Kong
- We took a boat ride to Kwo Chau Islands, a cluster of islands that dots the southeastern waters of Sai Kung, resembling floating fruits as their Cantonese name suggests. With the aid of a rugged headland, we docked at the southern part of this uninhabited archipelago.

- On New Year's Day, we were graced with a remarkable sunset above the clouds. The blend of hues stretched from the distant sky, cascading warm amber upon the slopes. Despite subsequent visits to Tai Mo Shan, I have yet to witness the return of such glows.

``Jan 2019`` [Annapurna Base Camp Trek](https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/trail/nepal/gandaki-pradesh/annapurna-base-camp-trek--2?sh=qlmoma), Gandaki, Nepal
- As you venture forth along the valley,the Annapurna massif embraces you, encircling your path with its awe-inspiring presence. The extraordinary range of mountains soars above 7,000 meters, featuring Machapuchare (6,993 m), Gangapurna (7,455 m), and the legendary Annapurna I (8,091 m). 
- When I awoke to the morning light, the sun gilded the south face of Annapurna I with its golden rays.
