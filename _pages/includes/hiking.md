``Jan 2024`` [Lemosho Traverse](https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/trail/tanzania/kilimanjaro/mount-kilimanjaro-lemosho-traverse?p=-1&sh=qlmoma), Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania
- At the start of 2024, I finished Lemosho Traverse at Mt. Kilimanjaro. It is a 7-day-and-6-night expedition, hiking through moorland, alpine desert, snowy peak, and (on the last day) tropical forests. 
- On the summit night of Jan 5, we set off at 00:00 and marched towards Stella point (5756m AMSL), and eventually at around 7am reached Uhuru peak, Africa's highest point (5895m AMSL).
- "Hakuna matata", as the local guide assured us, means "There are no troubles".

``Oct 2023`` [MacLehose Trail: Section 2](https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/trail/hong-kong/sai-kung/maclehose-trail-section-2?sh=qlmoma), Sai Kung, Hong Kong
- Section 2 is known to be the essence of the famous trail. Along the 13.5 km hike, we were constantly surrounded by some of Hong Kong's most stunning beaches. We did not visit Sharp Peak 「蚺蛇尖」, the sharpest peak in HK, due to time constraints. You can tell that from the photo! We will have the chance someday.
