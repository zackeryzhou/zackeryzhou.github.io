``Nov 2022`` [Real-time Rendering of Infinity Mirrors](https://zackeryzhou.github.io/InfinityMirror/Zhou_Rui_Infinity_Mirrors_Rendering.pdf), **Rui Zhou**. [[Demo]](https://zackeryzhou.github.io/InfinityMirror/)
- This project proposes a real-time rendering approach for infinity mirrors from a rasterization perspective. 
- While ray tracing is the natural choice, its efficiency is largely constrained by computational resources. Instead, to achieve real-time rendering, the work mitigates the artifacts in rasterization by controlling the number of reflections and the degree of light attenuation.

``Jun 2021`` [Post-Model-Selection Inference — A Study on a Mixed Residual Bootstrap Procedure](https://zackeryzhou.github.io/Capstone/Zhou_Rui_Capstone.pdf), **Rui Zhou**, supervised by Prof. Stephen Lee.
- The project unmasks how omitting the model-selection effect may lead to absurd conclusions on hypothesis tests and misleading confidence intervals.
- It focuses on a mixed residual bootstrap procedure devised to estimate the distributions of post-model-selection least squares estimators under a linear regression setting. The central interest is to investigate the empirical performance of the method in the face of different degrees of model misspecification.
